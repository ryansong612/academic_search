With the ability to cultivate crops and raise livestock, early humans were able to establish permanent settlements, leading to the development of more complex social structures. As communities grew, individuals began to specialize in various tasks, such as farming, crafting, and governing, further contributing to the growth and complexity of early civilizations."
